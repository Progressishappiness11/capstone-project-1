    <h1>Tanner Hatch</h1>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My background and experience is working primarily in Supply Chain
      Operations. I spent the last 10 years working between contract
      manufacturing, final assembly, purchasing/procurement, inventory
      management, and project management. Though I am new to the career of
      Web-Developement, I think that my well rounded experience can bring great
      value to the work flow of what the code needs to accomplish for a company
      and/or customer to be successful.
